To do list

All pages
    Make current page in nav not a link/yellow
    General neatening up of layout
    DONE Remove page border
    *Responsive: make it so the menu is in line with my name when 
    the page is big but under the tag line when smaller 
        I think the easiest way to do this is to create two 
        separate versions that appear/disappear as the page changes size
